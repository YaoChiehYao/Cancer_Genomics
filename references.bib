  abstract  = "Numerous large-scale genomic studies of matched tumor-normal
               samples have established the somatic landscapes of most cancer
               types. However, the downstream analysis of data from somatic
               mutations entails a number of computational and statistical
               approaches, requiring usage of independent software and numerous
               tools. Here, we describe an R Bioconductor package, Maftools,
               which offers a multitude of analysis and visualization modules
               that are commonly used in cancer genomic studies, including
               driver gene identification, pathway, signature, enrichment, and
               association analyses. Maftools only requires somatic variants in
               Mutation Annotation Format (MAF) and is independent of larger
               alignment files. With the implementation of well-established
               statistical and computational methods, Maftools facilitates
               data-driven research and comparative analysis to discover novel
               results from publicly available data sets. In the present study,
               using three of the well-annotated cohorts from The Cancer Genome
               Atlas (TCGA), we describe the application of Maftools to
               reproduce known results. More importantly, we show that Maftools
               can also be used to uncover novel findings through integrative
               analysis.",
